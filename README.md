# Node.js Chat App


## Pre-requisites

To setup and run the project for local development / testing, you will need to use Node.js and NPM. I don't explicitly specify a minimum Node.js/NPM version for the app but I recommend going with whatever the latest LTS version is at the point in time you are setting things up. The minimum vesion of Node.js that I have tested this app on is **10.16.3**.






Open a terminal window session, or the equivalent on your machine, and enter the following command to install all the Node modules needed to run the app:

```sh
npm install
```

## Run the app in development mode

After doing an `npm install` enter the following `npm run` command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the app and set it up to listen for incoming connections on port 3000. Open up your browser of choice and go to the url [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to start using the app itself. The `npm run dev` command automatically runs the app using the `nodemon` script so any changes you make to the app's javascript, CSS or HTML code will automatically restart it.
